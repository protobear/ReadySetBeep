# Ready, Set, Beep!

**Ready, Set, Beep!** is my first iPhone app—proof that learning Swift can help solve weirdly specific problems. It's for anyone who, like me, forgets to count while running or interval training. It keeps your rhythm by beeping at custom intervals, all while letting you groove to your favorite music.

## Key Features
- **Custom Intervals**: Set run/walk times (like "1 min run / 30 sec walk") to fit your goals.
- **Session Length**: Pick total workout time or just focus on running time.
- **Background Beeps**: Beeps work even if the app’s not on screen—because running and fiddling with your phone is just awkward.
- **Custom Beep Settings**: Tweak beep counts and volume so they suit you just right.

## How to Install
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ReadySetBeep.git`
2. Open in Xcode and run it. Make sure you have an Apple Developer account set up. 

## How to Use
1. **Set Up a Workout**: Pick your run/walk intervals, set the duration, and hit "Start."
2. **Listen for Beeps**: Follow the timer, and beep cues will tell you when to switch between running and walking.
